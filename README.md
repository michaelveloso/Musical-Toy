#Basic info:

This is a little musical toy for blissing out. Pressing the "letter rows" on your keyboard will queue up notes to play;
'Q' row plays piano notes, 'A' plays harp notes, and 'Z' plays cello pizzes. Hitting the space bar will play back random notes
immediately, without queueing them up.

You can change how fast queued notes back by pushing the speed buttons on the top row, and you can change the backing chord by
pushing the associated buttons (though it starts in C).
