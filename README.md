#Basic info:

This is a little musical toy for blissing out. Pressing the "letter rows" on your keyboard will queue up notes to play; 'Q' row plays piano notes, 'A' plays harp notes, and 'Z' plays cello pizzes. Hitting the space bar will play back random notes immediately, not queugin them up.

You can change how fast they play back by pushing the speed buttons on the top row, and you can choose the backing chord by pushing those associated buttons.
